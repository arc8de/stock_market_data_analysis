## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arc8de/stock_market_data_analysis.git
   cd stock_market_data_analysis
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install requirements**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or install the requiremnts onr at a time in your terminal in case of an error.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Or use your preferred IDE.

---

## Usage

1. Run the notebooks in order:
   - `1. Stock Data Cleaning.ipynb` (Fetches live data from Yahoo Finance)
   - `2. Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb`
   - `3. Predictive Modeling.ipynb`

2. By default, analysis is performed for a set of example tickers.  
   To analyze other stocks, see the section below.

**Note:** The sample output files use the default ticker symbol.  
You can update the ticker list in the notebooks to analyze different stocks.

## Changing the Analyzed Stocks

To analyze stock data for different companies:

1. Open `notebooks/1. Stock Data Cleaning.ipynb`.
2. Locate the following code cell:
   ```python
   tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 
              'JPM', 'GS', 'WMT', 'NVDA', 'NFLX']
   ```
3. Replace the ticker symbols in the `tickers` list with the symbols of the companies you want to analyze (e.g., `['META', 'TTM', ...]`).
4. Run all cells in the notebook to download and clean the new data.
5. The other notebooks (`2. Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` and `3. Predictive Modeling.ipynb`) will automatically use the updated data.

**Tip:** You can find ticker symbols for companies on Yahoo Finance or Google Finance.
